Dope with the darker laces!	1
These are really cool!	0
I slept on these and wishing I didn’t!! Major L! Nice shot!	1
Im gonna hard pass on the sock match up doe	0
These are actually 🔥	1
Great first pair dude, love the Orchid Tints. I wonder about the necessity of getting a second pair of UBs but this one is one of the few that are making me consider it haha.	1
Not feeling these at all	0
most comfortable shoe I ever owned	1
Love UBs, hate how gross Boost looks after awhile despite regular wipe downs.	0
Wow, this is so cool..	1
Absolute fire. Was on the brink of buying them the last couple of days but wasn’t sure and wasn’t feeling the default laces. But these look so nice and I love myself some colorful shoes.	1
Always thought they were cool even though everyone else called me knock off yeezys	1
Looks like a disassembled yeezy 2.... but idk about it	0
Just copped the Wolf Grey ones. These are fire but I understand the hate for the concept.	1
I had a pair. I think the silhouette is super cool, but they weren't very comfortable and the airbag on one of them squeaked from day one.	0
I heard there was gold in here. Might just be worth having to look at these fugly ass shoes lmao.	0
The right one is a discount Red October	0
I like the silhouette not so much the colourways tho	0
Colorways were nice	1
I really love these!	1
I think they look clean didnt see them for a while	1
Pretty clean imo	1
Like the blue more than the red tbf	0
The red pair is dope, miss me with that 4k price tag for the Red Octobers lmao	1
Nike just holding on to when they had Kanye	0
Very interesting heel, cool shoes!	1
These the red knockofftobers	0
Personally I mess with straps but the red ones do look a lot like red October’s. Still like them though!	0
I never shit on them but they're not for me	0
Maybe I’m alone but these are fire	1
dis shits fake	0
I think that might be the most disgusting cream color I’ve ever seen.	0	
Final product will look a lot better with the cocaine white outsole and correct shape	0
I legit love these. Definitely trying to get a pair when they drop.	1
I bet they comfy af though	1
I'm unsure about the bottoms but I LOVE the upper	1
You know those fake 10 pound yeezys on wish? Yea they look better than these trashes	0
All I see is hype honestly. If these weren’t Yeezy they wouldn’t even get looked at. I’ll take a hard pass on v3	0
The color of the soles on the creams look like candle wax in the worst way. Don’t see the appeal in the V3 design personally.	0
id cop in a different color	1						
Resellers will still try to cop. SMH.	0
I know it’s becoming a meme to roast Yeezys before they drop but these are for real hideous. By far the worst Yeezy model yet.	0
I’m glad they actually have some texture to them. The first pics looked smooth and cheap looking. Still don’t look as distinctive imo.	1
Love these. Most the people calling these ugly are still gonna try to cop when they release.	1
These aren’t bad	1
Real or not, if this is close to retail, issa drip for me.	1
Ruining the Yeezy line one shoe at a time. Imo these are the worst yet. I have appreciation for pretty much every yeezy so far. I’m really not getting these and the bball ones tho.	0
These look like a dried up cum stain.	0
Not a fan. But I’m not a big fan of the v1 or v2 either	0
Ngl I’m kinda liking these yellow ones	1
Everyone hating on them but this is probably the only Yeezy I could see myself wearing	1
if the midsole wasn't prosthetic leg beige I'd give them more of a chance	0
I just don't get the appeal of them, for me they look like a worse v2. I really dislike the sole especially.	0
these are genuinely vile	0
They really need new colourways. Hell, even something of a camo vibe would do me good.	1
I miss the ribbing on the midsole but still like them overall. Definitely something different.	1
Aren’t these really just rebranded Ultraboost Uncaged, but with a less bouncy sole?	0
I like them but I dont really like the ankle, I dont like how it just suddenly ends, it needs something to top it off	1
These look way better on feet.	1												
Wait wtf are these?	0
Honestly even after all the hype died down the yeezy is such a great shoe	1
Such a unique design. Pumped you could get these	1
v2s way better. these just look like roshes tbh	1
One of my favorite shoes of all time	1
v1s are the worst silhouette, its like a fuckin moccasin youd find at walmart	0
I would have refused that offer tbh	0
I like em but i think theyde be more fire with a ribbed midsole	1
they aint bad	1
I actually like them	1
Easy pass for me	0
I knew the V3 was going to look trash. V2 for life fam.	0
I must be the only one these thinks these are HEAT!	1
These turds literally trigger my trypophobia	1
3 months from now you are going to regret not copping	1
I would love to have this	1
Skechers ass midsoles	0
these look a lot better than the whites but i still like the v1's and v2's way better	1
Retails will look much better than these awful early fakes, this is like comparing those flea market "yeezys" to the real deal	0
This is high key my favorite new silhouette to come out since the Air Jordan 33, and before that, I dont know what	1
This shoe would look better with the right colorway. All there is to it	0
These are fire!	1
These are lowkey flames.	1
Paint fill looks like shit how did this pass QA	0
Pretty against. I mean I wouldn’t be mad at them for $150-200 and could overlook the quality issues, and it might just be this particular release, but maaaan...	0
When I see this model nothing about it says $300.	0
Is the grey paint on the midsole really that sloppy??	0
Best fucking 700	1
I don't care for the Magnets (yet), but that swap looks awesome.	1
Better than Static for me. (Dirty pair of Static, which makes it even nicer).	1
This picture made me realize that i need to sell my statics for lundmarks.	1
love these	1
Noice	1
nice 💣💣	1
Inertia’s are the best 700 cw fight me	1
The Magnets from a top down view doesn't look good.	0
V2 Inertias are fucking fire.	1
So glad I wasn’t tempted by the Magnets. They ugly boiii!	0
I just can't get into the V2's. There's just too much going on.	0
The magnets look amazing	1
different colourway and they have potential. hate the transparent stripe though	0
Would need to see them in other pics with different lighting for me to make a conclusive decision...plus they might change it up but who knows	0
For me the uppers are the issue. It’s that strange as midsole-to-upper blending thing. Just odd to me.	0
I like em	1
Never been a big yeezys fan but they seen to be getting worse.	0
Every time I see a 350 post I check stockx and come dangerously close to copping a pair or two. The beluga CW is easily in my top 5.	1
They are nice af. Just don't leave the cat alone with them!	1
I would go for the black, but cmon give it a red hit like the pirate black will do it good.	1
Maybe they will grow on me like the 700s, but for now I don’t like em	0
I really hope these are fake. The quality of the seam and the top, the ankle collar and the heel pull all look like they are inside out.	0
Looks like a cheaper version of the Dame Lillard 4s	0
I actually really like them, better than V1s	1
These are crazy	1
Looks like an Autobot.	1
These are amazing! I love crazy pairs of sneakers.	1
Naruto vibes	1
nice!	1
I've always like those. Did you get a good deal?	1
These are gorgeous. I want these real real bad.	1
I have mine still. I hate how fat of a shoe they are but I love them at the same time.	1
I slept on almost every OG CW air max over the last few years. I’m doubling up on these.	1
White laces go hard	1
Very nice pickup! I got a pair myself but still debating whether to wear them haha they look so nice crispy	1
Dope with the darker laces!	1
These are really cool!	1
I want these, where can I get them	1
These look cozy. Nice pair man	1
Hope I can get a chance to design my own these are dope	1
Oh man these are nice, my only consolation is that these aren't 1s otherwise I'd cry myself to death for missing out	1
wow this looks really clean! please post some on feet pics :D	1
So, so mad I missed out	1
I can't believe i missed out on this...	1
I swear the static print/pattern is gorgeous	1
Good shit brother	1
I sacrificed smoking and eating for a week but it was well worth it	1
Worst reps I’ve ever seen	0
that sole looks like shit	0
For the love of all that is holy.. Wear socks with your shoes! Especially if they have a hole the size of the grand canyon in the side of them.. lol	0
One of the most unique pairs I’ve seen. Nice work!	1
This is a true masterpiece grail😍😍💯	1
This is not a yeezy, ew ugly /s	0
Wow. So dope! What are those?!	1
not bad	1
Lots of people hate gum bottoms, but I like them.	1
I’d just change the lace colours they.look they nike nice now too	1
Love the lace choice	1
Maybe try a lighter gray	0
I like them. Maybe wouldn’t be my first pick, but they’re pretty stylish	1
Lol pass for me	0
I love tailwinds but these are so sick	1
These are dope! What’s retail on these?	1
like there’s already a stigma with all Black Air Forces, but these joints? You ready lay it all on the table	1
Cap and clown	0
Don’t do it. The gloss black part looks very weird in real life.	0
I might cop if they used the normal leather instead of patent leather and add 3m. But these... nah	0
Fiahhhh imo!	1
They’re aight imo. If the react midsole is hella comfortable it will probably sway my opinion	1
They’re aite...would prefer some other colorways...of course most ppl are going to say they’re wack, trash etc.	1
Strap needs to go, the weird swoosh needs to be flat.	0
trash imo	0
i think they have a boot like feel? so i like the brown colorway better.	0
Nah, keep the real things	0
Do what makes you happy. But IMHO, keep the Unions that you babe. They are timeless.	1
I like them but you need to change the color of swoosh	1
Why can't we just stick to actual releases? this would make any hypebeast nut in his pants, but for me they're a straight nah	0
Go up AT LEAST .5 a size. Fuego on feet and comfortable just go up a size.	1
i personally own this pair. So it may sound bias but is the only vapormax 97 colorway I like... the other ones were all trash IMO	1
I used to have these! They were actually my first pair of sneakers beyond vans. They’re nice in hand and look great on foot, definitely recommend.	1
I really don't like vapormax 😕 but if you like them you should buy	0
Not terrible but at this point just get some 6’s	0
I got the black and gold color way, I get compliments on, but I just use em to ball in flex w the retros	1
Just get some cheap 6s	0
I’m not feeling these tbh	0
I think these look disgusting like this.	0
I really don't like it but, I also didn't like the v2's when I first saw them so maybe these will grow on me too.	0
Thanks. I hate them.	0
agree the rendering looks bad IMO. wait for on feet pics and they may grow on you.	0
I'm sorry if it offends anyone but these are absolutely hideous.	0
Huuuuge fan. Cannot wait until these drop	1
Lol these are trash	0
If you like them, that’s all that matters but I also like them so you’re not alone	1
These look sick	1
I mean they’re ok imo but whatever you like my boy	1
I adore my pair, nice pickup	1
Grey toe is ugly. The rest of the shoe is fuego	0
Clean	1
Very sleek. Would insta cop	1
Personally, I think these are ugly. The $.99 ones were way cooler.	0
These are definitely supra trash	0
Throw them away	0
Just blaze them into a furnace	0
They will look better in person	0
I like them but i'd like so see them on feet and near the static cw to see the differences	0
Yeezys always tend to look better in person.	1
dope show love the orange air bubble	1
I like them. They are not super flashy but they have enough to draw the eye. I would get them if I wasn't planning to get the white windbreaker se colorway soon.	1
Blackberry cheesecake forces	1
Those are Nicee	1
Sail and white def doesn’t look good to me, but you do you, as long as you like em	0
Very very nice work	1
I personally love that sail/white contrast. I'd love to see them on feet	1
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥	1
The white and cream combo is awesome, wouldn’t have thought that would work but it does	1
I mean, it's out there	0
Not really feeling it like the 33s or 33 SEs. Might have to wait to see the different colorways	0
They get uglier every new iteration	0
Poopoo	0
Painted part on the midsole looks out of place.	0
yawn	0
Heavily conflicted. I think it's a dope colorway for the 700 V2 and very versatile. But it's hard to justify paying that price for a relatively plain shoe.	0
I missed on the Statics so these could be a nice alternative. I'll probably grab them	1
I could justify the v1, but the v2 legit looks like a Walmart shoe. I have gone to Walmart and seen shoes with that same mesh.	0
Gorgeous	1
just got the interias v2 they look sleek but these are dope also, ive got static 350's so ill prob pass on these 700. But if you dont own a white/gray cW id say cop. 300 aint bad	1
Thoughts on the second most popular shoes rn	1
Sad cuz couldnt cop em in Serbia.taxes will kill me if I get em off goat/stock x	1
Give us that side view too! What model did you use for the customization?	1
Bro those are hella dope! I’d cop. It reminds me of the Sean Wotherspoon.	1
I like it. Very nice. Only thing I’d maybe change is the light brown, but that’s just me :)	1
They look hot, figuratively and literally. Summer in the southwest in corduroy and, is that a fleece toe? They're fresh but your feet are gonna cook.	1
Definitely 🔥 👍	1
Looks like parra’s	1
So clean	1
Customs?	1
would be cool if the sole of the shoes had the corresponding colours as well	0
Nah, get some that match the cream sole or the coral	1
Nope	0
Neh	0
Yuh	1
Is the wife’s kick game as strong?	1
Nice laces	1
Thanos ultraboost	1
Woof!	1
Go Dawgs baby those are a must cop	1
I need these Thanos UBs man.	1
These are insane	1
Not a Huskies fan but these are sharp!	1
That's a nice Wario cw	1
OH MY GAWD	1
Jesus. Did not cop. They went fast. I fucking hate the sneaker game. Where's the best place I can get these from the sharks?	1
How did you take this pic. Fuckin awesome	1
Damn. everyone at school is already wearing boost. Now it will be all the same cw	1
Same to you bud! I need to start playing myself and just buy these already	1
Where did you get those pants?	1
Love those pants!	1
You too bro. Fresh kicks btw! Love these shoes and they really work well with those pants.	1
My guy, your collection is crazy🔥	1
keep that same energy 🤛		1
fresh squeezed 🍊🍊	1
Such a clean pair 😍	1
These are reverse SBBs right?	1
Beautiful!	1
This is good to see rather than just sat on top of a box 👍🏻 look way better on feet too	1
I'm hard.	1
Really got my fingers crossed for a release of the Back to the Future colors... Either way, these look great OP.	1
Shut up and take my money	1
These are it. Looks like something out of the future and I can’t stand that I missed out on them.	1
Jeez where can I get these from?	1
Good Lord these are gorgeous	1
Oh man!! I wish I could adapt these.	1
These look sick asf	1
Damn thats fire!	1
What are these?	1
I love the colors but I think these look better with the thicker rope laces. If there's multicolor rope laces I think that would be the best combo for these.	1
Just ordered this pair! Super hyped.	1
Slick. Nicely done!	1
These are so some of the best HUs to release yet they didn’t really get much hype. These are so dope. I also think they are strangely more comfortable then some of the other HUs out there for some reason.	1
Clean	1	1
Wow! This looks incredible!!	1
Those gum bottoms are fire	1
That’s like a pretty perfect lace swap. 🔥	1
Thats perfection !	1
Color laces make the kicks. Dig it.	1
Damn that looks good	1
Why would you not use a Nike ball tho?	0
Definitely cool, but wouldn’t it be uncomfortable?	0
these are so unique	1

Bro I want these so bad. I’m saving up rn so I can but them in 12. Enjoy the heat man!	1
You got yourself a keeper bro	1
Absolutely fuego 🔥🔥🔥	1
Congrats dude. But for real tho, even the reflective model doesn’t have reflective laces??	1
I'm salty af. It sold out immediately after I clicked checkout.	1
Very clean.	1
These look fucking sick!	1
how is the size of the Nike Air Force 1? I bought 9US but they were exaggeratedly large	1
I like everything except the tongue	1
I have these too and they are wayyy nicer in person imo one of the best shoes I have	1
Unbelievable how those have such a unique silhouette	1
Geez	1
Them shits right there are my favorite sneakers of all time	1
They are pretty cool man, I'd definitely wear them, congrats!	1
Gum soles for life. I don’t understand the hate on them.	1
You mean what soled you?	1
Funny cause the gum soles are what's have kept me away from buying these 😂 but they look nice thou! 	1
Damn I've been looking for a pic of how they look with a lace swap and they look beautiful! Have you tried out orange/yellow laces as well?	1
I love the shoe model but hate the thick soles. Thats the only thing keeping me from buying pharrel nmds. I love the og ones tho	0
Do they come with extra laces or did you swap from another pair?	1
I really wish Pharrell hu nmd to be cheaper..cant afford em	0
the only problem with gum soles is that you're stepping in gum all day..	0
How do these fit? I am a wide footer	1
I love this shoe but I am also broken *cries in size 10	1
How are you lacing that knot		1
The trash trail sole is keeping me from buying any human races right now...	0
Ugly 🤢	0
Honestly I would buy the shoe if The sole is black, that gum sole is just not my taste	0
The perfect shoes to play Borderlands 3 with	1
Thumb looks like it’s about to go after the Spy Kids	0
Why would you do that	0
stitching looks off	0
Physically in pain looking at this.	0
r/cursedimages	0
What are those😂			0
I saw this on facebook this morning and he got them from Wish lmao	0
Hmm boost looks a little off. Not sure though	0
Looks like a product of shoe incest	0
damn someone really spent some time on that	0
gross	0
Holy pairs on stairs	1
These are love	1
Dope line up	1
Jesus dude. Some people just have so much talent.	1
It’s a pretty good custom I’m just not a fan of high end brands like Lv on air forces	1
I like the addition of the chain but I feel like LV customs are seriously overdone.	0
Love these so much I’d buy a pair if they were for sale	1
Fantastic. Love the crep outsole and the corduroy	1
Nothing special in my eyes	0
Idk I kinda hate them but that’s just me	0
I’m glad it’s not just a slightly different variation of the Statics	1
Not feeling them. The colors are too bizarre. Definitely interesting but they look like kids colors to me.	0
Well, you guys wanted crazy colors...	0
Definitely most interesting colorway in a 350 in a LONG time, IMO. Still wouldn’t personally pay retail for them, but they aight	1
Changing color on the same fabric panel doesn’t make sense to me. On other shoes where there’s a change of material, a different thickness, etc, it’s easier to justify a color transition. These don’t do it for me	0
Us sneaker heads always find an excuse to buy a new pair of sneakers haha love it	0
It's a pretty clean colorway but it's also got some buzz lightyear vibes	1
Those are beautiful I need them	1
Too much going on	0
Nice find. I wear my 270s almost daily	1
Pretty sure fake	0
The loose lace trend needs to stop..	0
Pretty sure they’re fake guy	0
Bottom sole looks off and toe box material doesn’t match up. Look like reps/fakes...	0
Waves stick out so much. Color in a sea of bland.	0
That's a lot of damage	0
yezus!	1
now you need some adidas socks my dude	1
Please take that StockX tag off of them	0
stockx tag and black nike socks? this ain't it chief	0
Bro. Why disrespect adidas like that?	0
fuck yo sucks	0
This picture does a great job showing how they have a bit of a green tint to them. I was surprised to see that when I got mine. And you’re right, so so comfy.	1
Naw man don't, these just be some Lundmarks or Statics. Don't cop, especially not in size 10.	0
You can never go wrong with Waverunners. Best 700's indeed.	1
These are more alien than the 350 v3s	0
They remind me of dinosaur fossils	0
If you don’t wear a skeleton costume with these what are you even doing with your life.	1
I know yeezys are all about subtlety but I want these to come out in some WILD colorways	0
I feel like I personally hate all of the v3’s we’ve been seeing.	0
i prefer foam runners	0
I don’t think they are scuba samples, he took them straight off his feet. If this is sarcasm then woosh for me	0
Lol those are just Kanye’s socks	0
Just a bunch of fat fucks ogling a fugly shoe	0
He’s checking the tags to see if they’re legit	0
The tongues on these look like the wave runner tongues. I hope they go back to that look for the V1s	0
So ugly...	0
I like Kaws but the art really shows up how ugly the sillohuetttes of these Yeezs really are.	0
You should go up 2 sizes since you want to look like a clown.	0
People would pay hundreds for these just to look like clowns	0
disgusting	0
this is disturbing	0
these are hilarious, i'd wear them just to see what people say.	0
No.	0
Omg no	0
Kill it. Kill it with fire.	0
Ok nah these are gross	0
Taking out the trash in these	0
pukes everywhere	0
Ewww	0
I fucking hate crocs but these would look good for the beach	0
NO.	0
I swear the static print/pattern is gorgeous	1
Nah, get some that match the cream sole or the coral	0
Nope	0
not again	0
Why Kanye why	0
F to pay respects	0
Just throw them away	0
Personally not a fan of the 500s, but still a nice pickup regardless.	0
Actually more interesting then the rehash of 700s they drop every month	1
